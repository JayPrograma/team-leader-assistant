# Team Leader Assistant

## Introduction:
The following piece of software is a simple program designed to serve as a virtual assistant to a Team Leader in a service program.
Uses for the TLA include delegating tasks to members in a random and fair manner, keeping track of who they've worked with,
and keeping track of what tasks they've done before.

## TODO:
*   create tests for current class methods 
*   create random delegation functionality 
*   create functionality to save and load information from external file
